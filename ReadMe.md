CS580 Project - Depth of Field
==============================

Depth of filed is an effect in photography by which only the objects which are in focus of the camera lens will appear sharp and other objects will appear blurry. Our project objective is to simulate this effect. We will implement several techniques to achieve this and make comparisions among these techniques.
